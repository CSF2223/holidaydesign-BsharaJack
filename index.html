Legend has it that while Santa brings toys to “nice” children,
Krampus’ job is to punish kids on the “naughty” list. Mostly he just frightens the children with his beastly looks, but it’s said
that he throws particularly bad children into his sack, or chains them up in his basket and carts them off to Hell. People in Austria
and neighboring countries often dress up as Krampus in early December and wander the streets to scare children.

sell radishes that have been intricately carved to depict nativity scenes, local wildlife, familiar architecture and other relevant displays.
The radish carvings are sold as Christmas centerpieces, and the creator of the best radish design wins a monetary prize.

                <a href="https://groovyhistory.com/kfc-japan-christmas-kentucky-fried-chicken/2"><img src="assets/KFC for Christmas.jpg"></img></a>In the United States, we associate Christmas with ham or figgy pudding, but in Japan, it’s all about Kentucky Fried Chicken.
An estimated 3.5 million Japanese families eat fried chicken on Christmas Eve thanks to a marketing stunt by KFC in the 1970s
called Kurisumasu ni wa Kentakkii (“Kentucky for Christmas”). Christians make up a very small percentage of the Japanese population,
so this campaign made up for a lack of Christmas holiday traditions. The KFC Christmas Meal is so popular, many customers pre-order
their dinners — which include fried chicken, cake and champagne — months in advance.
